<!-- 01 Html Basic Layout -->
<!-- Now have an html file what do we do with this? -->
<!-- We need to put in it what's called html tags. HTML files are full of html tags which surrounds content. -->
<!-- Opening tags content in the middle and closing tag -->
<!-- <h1>Tags Syntax</h1>
<h2>Elements surrounds in angle brackets</h2>
<p>Usually having start and end tag</p>

<br>
<p>Some tags close themselves (Remnant of XHTML)</p>
<h1>This is my website.</h1>
<p>This is my very first website</p> -->

<!-- Above one is not the standard od how to create html document there is some other thing the 
we need to add to make it valid html -->

<!-- The first thing you gonna want on every html page is the DOCTYPE -->

<!-- what it does it tells the brower what type of document it is, because browser can read html5, html4.0.1, xhtml
so there are lots of variation of html but html5 is the standard, easier than other and less strict when its comes to tag syntax
-->
